  <p>Max has severe epilepsy. Without his medication after 24 hours, he'll start to have seizures. It is crucial that he is found soon.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to help the search effort, meet around 6PM where the trailhead begins. If you can go sooner, or can't go until later, that helps too.</p>
  <p>If you have more questions, please contact Erika Klassen at rixology94 (at) gmail (dot) com, or 913-206-2900.</p>
