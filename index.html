  <p>Max was last seen on the Mt. Aire trailhead at around 9PM on 6/15/2016. You can get directions using the map below.</p>

  <p>More specifically, he was last seen on the north slope near the ridge where the creek turns to mostly mud between two aspen coves.</p>
  <p>Max is a 10 year old Australian Shepherd black tri. No tail.</p>
  <p>He has epilepsy and has gone over 24 hours without his meds so will probably show signs of having had a seizure. I.e. lots of drool down his face and check and his eyes look a little crazier than normal.</p>
  <p>He also has separation anxiety so he will probably be all around very panicked. Does well on car rides. Does not like being picked up but shouldn't bite.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to help the search effort, meet around 6PM where the trailhead begins. If you can go sooner, or can't go until later, that helps too.</p>
  <p>If you have more questions, please contact Erika Klassen at rixology94 (at) gmail (dot) com, or 913-206-2900.</p>
